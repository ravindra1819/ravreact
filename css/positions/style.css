Positioning in CSS : 

    CSS positions is a concept helps us to place HTML elements in different positions on a web page.

    There are several types of positioning in CSS:

    1. Static Positioning
       - Default positioning for all HTML elements.
       - Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
       
    2. Relative Positioning
       - Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.
       - You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust the position.

    3. Absolute Positioning
       - Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
       - If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).


    4. Fixed Positioning
       - Elements are positioned relative to the viewport.
       - They remain fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

    5. Sticky Positioning
       - Elements are treated as relative until they reach a specified scroll position, then they become fixed.
       - Useful for creating headers that stick to the top of the page when scrolling.
