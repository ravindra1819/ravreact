    Core Components :

        Tags :
            - Tags are nothing but predefined keywords in HTML.
            - Every keyword is loaded with some predefined functionality.
            - Tags are used to create HTML elements.

        Syntax :  <tagName> Content </tagName>

        Types of Tags :

            1. Single Tags : Tags which do not require either opening or closing tag.
                - Example : <img> , <input> , <br> , <hr> etc.

            2. Paired Tags : Tags which require both opening and closing tag.
                - Example : <h1> , <p> , <div> , <a>

            
        Attributes :
            - Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
            - Attributes are always specified in the opening tag.
            - Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like : name="value".

        Class vs ID : 
            - Class is used to apply the same styles to multiple elements.
            - ID is used to apply styles to a single, unique element.
            - In CSS, class selectors are denoted with a dot (.) and ID selectors with a hash (#).

        Types of Attributes : 

            1. Global Attributes : Attributes that can be used with any HTML element.
                - Example : id , class , style , title , data-* etc.

            2. Element Specific Attributes : Attributes that are specific to certain HTML elements.
                - Example : href (for <a>), src (for <img>), alt (for <img>), type (for <input>) etc.



        Elements :
            - Elements are the building blocks of HTML.
            - An element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
            - Example : <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

                        <h1 class="heading" style="color: white; background-color: black; ">Content</h1>

        Types of Elements : 

            1. Inline Elements:
            - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
            - Example : <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em> etc.

            2. Block Elements:
            - Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available.
            - Example : <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <section> etc.

            3. Inline-Block Elements:
            - Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, but they can have width and height set.
            - Example : <img>, <button>, <input> etc.
